## Climate action

Get the **Climate Action Panda** to respond to the **Main Panda's** `broadcasts`{:class="block3events"}, creating an action that will help explain the [Climate Action](https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-13-climate-action.html) sustainable development goal.

Here is the code you have already. There is some music and some text explaining the **Climate Action Panda** goal as well as a script that gets the **Climate Action Panda** to `hide`{:class="block3looks"} `when flag clicked`{:class="block3events"}.

Start a new script with the `when backdrop switches to [Climate Action v]`{:class="block3events"} and use a `show`{:class="block3looks"} block to show the **Climate Action Panda** on the stage.

```blocks3
