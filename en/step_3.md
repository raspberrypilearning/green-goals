## Climate action

Get the **Climate Action Panda** to respond to the Main Panda's `broadcast`{:class="block3events"}, creating an action that will help explain the Climate Action Green Goal.

Here is the code you have already. There is some music and some text explaining the panda's goal as well as a script that gets the panda to `hide`{:class="block3looks"} `when the flag is clicked`{:class="blocks3constrol"}.

You will then program the Green Goal sprites to hide and only show up when their backdrop appears.
