## Introduction

The United Nations is an organisation in which countries work together to make the world a better place. In this project, you will create an animation about the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals that focus on the environment. The five environment-focused goals are:
+ [Affordable and Clean Energy](https://www.undp.org/sustainable-development-goals#affordable-and-clean-energy){:target="_blank"}
+ [Responsible Consumption and Production](https://www.undp.org/sustainable-development-goals#responsible-consumption-and-production){:target="_blank"}
+ [Climate Action](https://www.undp.org/sustainable-development-goals#climate-action){:target="_blank"}
+ [Life Below Water](https://www.undp.org/sustainable-development-goals#below-water){:target="_blank"}
+ [Life on Land](https://www.undp.org/sustainable-development-goals#life-on-land){:target="_blank"}

We've named these goals 'Green Goals'.

### What you will make

--- no-print ---
Click on the green flag to start the animation and watch **Main Panda** interact with the five pandas that represent the ‘Green Goals’: **Climate**, **Energy**, **RRR**, **Water**, and **Land**.

The **Main Panda** sprite walks through five different scenes. In each scene, a different panda sprite explains their goal with actions, sounds, and words.
