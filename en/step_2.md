In this project, there is one **Main Panda** sprite that walks through the UN Sustainable Development Goals (Green Goals) and introduces the other pandas. Each Green Goal has its own Panda sprite and its own backdrop.

You will be programming the **Main Panda** sprite to walk through each of the 5 backdrops representing the Green Goals.

As you may remember if you've done the Focus on the Prize project, **Broadcasts** are messages that are sent by a sprite for some or all other sprites to receive.

In the `Events`{:class="block3events"} blocks menu, select the `broadcast`{:class="block3events"}, `broadcast next`{:class="block3events"}, and `whenflagclicked`{:class="block3events"} blocks

--- task ---

Arrange the blocks so that you have two scripts, one for animating the backdrops, and the other for the **Main Panda** sprite.
