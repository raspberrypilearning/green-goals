In this project, there is one main UN Panda that walks through the goals and introduces the other pandas. Each Green Goal has its own Panda sprite and its own backdrop.

In this step, you will be programming the main UN Panda to walk through each of the 5 backdrops representing the Green Goals, triggering the next backdrop.

You will then program the Green Goal Sprites to hide and only show when their backdrop appears.
